To create an automated script to Update all of your LXC Containers daily at 2:00am:

In your Proxmox Host console, start by creating a new bash file named ‘autoupdate.sh’ by running:
	
	nano /opt/autoupdate.sh

And copy/paste in the below code.  It’ll start any off containers, update them, and then shut them down.  It’ll leave on but update any containers that are running.

	#!/bin/bash
	# update all containers

	# list of container ids we need to iterate through
	containers=$(/usr/sbin/pct list | tail -n +2 | cut -f1 -d' ')

	function update_container() {
	  container=$1
	  echo "[Info] Updating $container"
	  # to chain commands within one exec we will need to wrap them in bash
	  /usr/sbin/pct exec $container -- bash -c "apt update && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y"
	}

	for container in $containers
	do
	  status=`/usr/sbin/pct status $container`
	  if [ "$status" == "status: stopped" ]; then
	    echo [Info] Starting $container
	    /usr/sbin/pct start $container
	    echo [Info] Sleeping 5 seconds
	    sleep 5
	    update_container $container
	    echo [Info] Shutting down $container
	    /urs/sbin/pct shutdown $container &
	  elif [ "$status" == "status: running" ]; then
	    update_container $container
	  fi
	done; wait


Now use Ctrl+x, Y, and Enter to close, save, and exit the “nano” text editor.

In your console, you can run /bin/bash /opt/autoupdate.sh and watch it run once to make sure it works....but this is optional.

Still in your Proxmox host console, run the below to get into your cronjobs file.  Select “nano” if it asks.
	crontab -e
	 
At the bottom, create a new line that simply says:

	0 2 * * * /bin/bash /opt/autoupdate.sh

Then simply use Ctrl+x, Y, and Enter to close, save, and exit.  You’re all set.

To change when your system updates, crontab.guru is a great site to help fix/change the line in your "crontab -e" file to suit your needs.
